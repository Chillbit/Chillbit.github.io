	  <h2>Radriome Mental Health Facility & Sanatorium - Est. 1922 | "There Is No Home Like Radriome" - Official Slogan</h2>
	  <h2>Facility closed due to massive ethics violations - October 18, 1979</h2>
	<h2>Facility acquired by the Department of Defense - July 22, 1980</h2>
	  <h2>Facility retrofitted as Radio Acoustic Listening Facility - October 2, 1980</h2>
	  <h2>Facility condemned due to leak of hazardous chemicals. 16 Dead, 51 injured. - May 10, 1986</h2>
	  
	  <h2>Do not believe these lies. Radriome was doing experiments. ESP, telemutasis, soma kinesis. Pre-1979 doing experiments on people, making them into something. Word got out, officially shut down, people arrested. Scape goats. DoD took interest, took over operations. Reinstated high level staff. Radio listening is a cover.</h2>
	  <h2>Not a chemical leak in 1986. Mass psychic incident. Patients turned on facility with their abilities. Horrible deaths for a few, many staff and other patients affected. Life long illness for most. Military gag order issued. 1980s, little spread of such news. Easy cover up then.</h2>
	  
	  <h1>Not anymore! I know the truth. Father was a victim, killed himself because of illness. Constant static in his head. I will spread the truth of what was happening at RADRIOME. I WILL FIND PROOF THERE.</h1>
